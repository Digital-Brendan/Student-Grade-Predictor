# Student Grade Predictor
This Project uses a regression machine learning algorithm to predict, with decent certainty, a student's final grade based on various specific attributes (age, number of school absences, number of test failures, etc).

Using C#, a forms application provides the GUI and SQLite3 provides a light-weight backend. Visual Studio and its ML.NET Model Builder allowed the training of the model based on the dataset below.
