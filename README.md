"StudentGradePredictor" (henceforth referred to as the "Project", the "Coursework", or the "Program") and its contents are developed by and are the sole property of Digital-Brendan (henceforth
referred to as the "Developer").

Any non-educational use of the Project, or any of its constituent parts, requires permission from the Developer.

This Project aims to use a regression machine learning algorithm to predict, with decent certainty, a student's final grade based upon various attributes (age, number of school
absences, number of test failures, etc).

Using C#, a forms application provides the GUI and SQLite3 provides a sufficiently light-weight database. Visual Studio and its ML.NET Model Builder allowed the training of the model based upon a sample dataset.
