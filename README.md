# StudentGradePredictor
WJEC Computer Science A-Level Unit 5

"StudentGradePredictor" (henceforth referred to as the "project", the "coursework", or the "program") and its contents are developed by and are property of Brendan Rogan (henceforth
referred to as "the developer").

Any non-educational use of the project, or any of its constituent parts, requires permission from the developer.

This project aims to use a regression machine learning algorithm to predict, with decent certainty, a student's final grade based upon various attributes (age, number of school
absences, number of test failures, etc).

Using C#, a forms application provides the GUI and SQLite3 provides a sufficient database. Visual Studio and its ML.NET Model Builder allowed the training of the model based
upon a sample dataset.
